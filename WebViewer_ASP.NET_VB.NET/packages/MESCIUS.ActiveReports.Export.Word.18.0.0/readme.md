ActiveReports is a unique collection of developer reporting tools that help consume, process, and visualize data in the form of compelling and easy-to-understand reports.

ActiveReports provides a lot of features for developers and end-users, like:
* VisualStudio integration support.

* Different possibilities to pivot and aggregate data.
* Rich data visualization.
* Popular export formats (like PDF/Excel/Word).
* And a lot more (https://developer.mescius.com/activereportsnet).

# Concept

This package includes the .NET and .NET Core assemblies required to export to MS Word-specific formats (DOC/DOCX/RTF).


## Note

Word exports are not WYSIWYG. Please check documentation for limitations.

## License

DOCX export requires a Professional Edition license.
