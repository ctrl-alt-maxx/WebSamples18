# Introduction

ActiveReports is a unique collection of developer reporting tools that help consume, process, and visualize data in the form of compelling and easy-to-understand reports.

ActiveReports provides a lot of features for developers and end-users, like:
* VisualStudio integration support.
* PaaS support (like Azure Linux App Service).
* Different possibilities to pivot and aggregate data.
* Rich data visualization.
* Popular export formats (like PDF/Excel/Word).
* And a lot more (https://developer.mescius.com/activereportsnet).

# Concept

This package includes the .NET and .NET Core assemblies required to create and render pixel-perfect reports:
* [PageReport](https://developer.mescius.com/activereportsnet/docs/latest/online/GrapeCity.ActiveReports~GrapeCity.ActiveReports.PageReport.html) is base class for Page/RDL reports (ActiveReports formats based on MS-RDL format).
* [SectionReport](https://developer.mescius.com/activereportsnet/docs/latest/online/GrapeCity.ActiveReports~GrapeCity.ActiveReports.SectionReport.html) is base class for XML/RPX and code-based Section reports.
