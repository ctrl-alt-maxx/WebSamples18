# Introduction

ActiveReports is a unique collection of developer reporting tools that help consume, process, and visualize data in the form of compelling and easy-to-understand reports.

ActiveReports provides a lot of features for developers and end-users, like:
* VisualStudio integration support.
* PaaS support (like Azure Linux App Service).
* Different possibilities to pivot and aggregate data.
* Rich data visualization.
* Popular export formats (like PDF/Excel/Word).
* And a lot more (https://developer.mescius.com/activereportsnet).

# Concept

This package includes the .NET and .NET Core assemblies with WinForms-based report designer control to design report layouts.

With designer control, it is easy to build an end-user report designer application. ActiveReports provides a wide range of sample reports, so report authors can create or modify reports according to their requirements.

## Note

The designer control doesn't support code-based Section reports.

## License

This feature requires a professional license.
